## An Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization for the Traveling Salesperson Problem
### Abstract
Ant Colony Optimization is one of the meta-heuristic approaches using an iterative
stochastic solution construction process. It has been developed different versions and
applications for generic NP-Hard problems since its first introduction. One of the fa-
mous one these problems is Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In this paper an
implementation of Ant System,  the first algorithm introduced as Ant Colony Opti-
mization,  built with Python Numpy library for TSP is introduced and tested some
small sized examples.  With relatively small sized data, some experiments show that
the algorithm is capable of finding optimal solution, but towards NP-Hard it is ob-
tained only nearer solutions.
